What is this ?
--------------

The result of a coding challenge, this is the first "game" I've written in Python, or in over 20 years.

The task was to make something like pong in < 3 hours, and this took me 2hrs and 43mins of coding time.

It has a bunch of bugs (mostly on double hits on the bat and some nasty copy+paste code on the ball bounces.

How to play
-----------

- Use Q and A to control the left bat
- Use UPARROW and DOWNARROW to control the right bat
- Press B to make a new ball if needed.

What to add
-----------

- A way to keep score.
- Instructions on how to play.
- The game should speed up to ensure someone loses.
